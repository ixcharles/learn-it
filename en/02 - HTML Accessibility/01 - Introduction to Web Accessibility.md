## Key Accessibility Principles (POUR)

**Definition**: POUR stands for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robustâ€”four core principles for accessible web design.

**Example**: Perceivable - Text alternatives for images; Operable - Keyboard navigability; Understandable - Clear language; Robust - Works across devices and platforms.

**Explanation**: These principles provide a framework for creating accessible websites and applications.
