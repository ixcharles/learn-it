## Performance Optimizations in TypeScript Code

While TypeScript itself doesn’t impact runtime, you can optimize type checking and build times.

### Tips:
- Use `skipLibCheck: true` to reduce build time.
- Split large types/modules into smaller units.
- Prefer `as const` to preserve literal types efficiently.

```typescript
const status = ["success", "error"] as const;
type Status = typeof status[number];
```

## TypeScript in Large-Scale Applications

Structure code for scalability with modular architecture, strict compiler settings, and consistent coding standards.

### Recommendations:
- Use path aliases (`paths` in `tsconfig.json`) for cleaner imports.
- Create shared utility and types libraries.
- Apply domain-driven design or feature-based folder structure.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@utils/*": ["utils/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## TypeScript and Frameworks (React, Angular, Node.js)

TypeScript integrates deeply with popular frameworks:

### React:

```tsx
type Props = { title: string };
const Header: React.FC<Props> = ({ title }) => <h1>{title}</h1>;
```

### Angular:

Angular uses TypeScript natively with decorators and strict typing.

### Node.js:

Use types from `@types/node` and CommonJS/ESM modules.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

---

## Working with TypeScript in a CI/CD Pipeline

Integrate TypeScript builds and checks in CI for stability and confidence.

### Example with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: TypeScript Build
  run: tsc --noEmit
```

Also include:

- Type checks (`tsc`)
- Linting (`eslint`)
- Tests (`jest` or similar)

## Migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript

Gradually migrate by renaming files and adding types incrementally.

### Steps:
1. Rename `.js` → `.ts` or `.jsx` → `.tsx`
2. Enable `allowJs` and `checkJs` in `tsconfig.json`
3. Slowly add type annotations or JSDoc comments
4. Convert third-party usage with `@types` packages

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    "checkJs": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

## Best Practices for TypeScript in Real-World Projects

- Always enable `strict` mode.
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` for safer handling.
- Keep types DRY with `type` and `interface`.
- Document types and utility functions for clarity.
- Prefer composition over inheritance in OOP patterns.

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways:
1. Optimize your TypeScript setup for performance and scalability.
2. Use modular architecture and shared types in large codebases.
3. Leverage TypeScript fully in frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.
4. Integrate type checks and builds into your CI/CD workflows.
5. Migrate from JavaScript incrementally with a smooth upgrade path.

### Practical Exercise:
1. Create a `tsconfig.json` optimized for a large project (with path aliases and strict mode).
2. Write a CI step to run `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` on push.
3. Build a typed React/Node module using shared interfaces across the stack.
4. Take a small JS file and refactor it to `.ts` with proper types and error handling.
