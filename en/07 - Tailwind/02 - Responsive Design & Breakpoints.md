## Mobile-First Design in Tailwind

**Definition**: Tailwind applies base utility classes to mobile screens by default, with larger breakpoints layered on top.

**Example**:
```html
<p class="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">Responsive Text</p>
```

Styles scale up from the smallest screen size.

---

## Understanding Breakpoints and Media Queries

**Definition**: Tailwind uses a predefined set of breakpoints tied to `min-width` media queries.

**Default Breakpoints**:
- `sm`: 640px
- `md`: 768px
- `lg`: 1024px
- `xl`: 1280px
- `2xl`: 1536px

**Example**:
```html
<div class="hidden md:block">Visible on medium screens and up</div>
```

Each prefix maps to a media query.

---

## Applying Responsive Utilities

**Definition**: Prefix utility classes with breakpoint names to apply them conditionally based on screen width.

**Example**:
```html
<div class="p-2 md:p-6 lg:p-12">Responsive Padding</div>
```

Tailwind automatically composes utilities for different breakpoints.

---

## Container and Screen Utilities

**Definition**: Use the `.container` class and the `screens` object in the config to manage layout width and breakpoints.

**Example**:
```html
<div class="container mx-auto px-4">Centered Content</div>
```

**Custom Container Widths**:
```js
theme: {
  container: {
    center: true,
    padding: '1rem',
    screens: {
      lg: '1024px',
      xl: '1280px',
    },
  },
}
```

---

## Building Fully Responsive Layouts

**Definition**: Combine responsive grid/flex utilities, spacing, and typography to build adaptive UIs.

**Example**:
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <div class="bg-white p-4 shadow">Card 1</div>
  <div class="bg-white p-4 shadow">Card 2</div>
  <div class="bg-white p-4 shadow">Card 3</div>
</div>
```

Use layout utilities with breakpoints to create fluid layouts.

---

## Custom Breakpoints and Screen Sizes

**Definition**: Tailwind allows custom breakpoints in the `screens` section of `tailwind.config.js`.

**Example**:
```js
theme: {
  screens: {
    xs: '480px',
    sm: '640px',
    md: '768px',
    lg: '1024px',
    xl: '1280px',
    '2xl': '1536px',
  },
}
```

You can tailor your responsive design to fit your project's specific needs.

### Practical Exercise

Create a responsive three-column layout that:
- Stacks vertically on mobile
- Displays two columns on medium screens
- Displays three columns on large screens
