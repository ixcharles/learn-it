# Component Architecture and Design Systems

Tailwind CSS is not only great for styling individual components but also helps build robust and scalable design systems. This course focuses on building reusable components, integrating Tailwind with component-based frameworks, and managing animations in a consistent and maintainable way.

## Building Reusable Components with Tailwind

**Definition**: Reusable components in Tailwind are built by composing utility classes in a way that keeps them flexible and easy to reuse across your application.

**Example**:
```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
  Click Me
</button>
```

By encapsulating the necessary utility classes into a single, reusable component, you can create a consistent UI and avoid repeating the same classes throughout your project.

---

## Structuring a Component Library

**Definition**: Organizing your components in a structured manner makes it easier to manage, maintain, and scale your application. A component library can store reusable UI components, and Tailwind helps streamline their styling.

**Example**:
```bash
src/
 ├── components/
 │    ├── Button.vue
 │    ├── Card.js
 │    └── Modal.svelte
 ├── assets/
 │    ├── images/
 │    └── icons/
 └── styles/
      └── tailwind.config.js
```

Structure your components in a modular way and use a consistent naming convention to maintain clarity.

---

## Managing Utility Classes with @apply

**Definition**: The `@apply` directive in Tailwind allows you to consolidate utility classes into custom CSS, improving readability and reusability.

**Example**:
```css
/* In your CSS file */
.btn {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded;
}

.btn-hover:hover {
  @apply bg-blue-700;
}
```

By using `@apply`, you can encapsulate Tailwind utilities into more semantic class names, making your HTML cleaner and easier to maintain.

## Tailwind and Component-Based Frameworks

### React

**Definition**: Tailwind can be easily used with React by applying utility classes directly in JSX, allowing for fast and dynamic styling.

**Example**:
```jsx
function Button() {
  return (
    <button className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
}
```

---

### Vue

**Definition**: In Vue, Tailwind can be applied directly in templates, and Tailwind's utility-first approach works well with Vue's component-based architecture.

**Example**:
```vue
<template>
  <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
    Click Me
  </button>
</template>
```

---

### Svelte

**Definition**: Tailwind integrates smoothly with Svelte, where you can apply utility classes directly to components, making Svelte apps lightweight and fast.

**Example**:
```svelte
<script>
  let label = "Click Me";
</script>

<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
  {label}
</button>
```

---

## Using Headless UI with Tailwind

**Definition**: Headless UI is a set of completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components designed to integrate with Tailwind CSS. It helps build highly customizable and accessible components without enforcing a specific style.

**Example**:
```jsx
import { Dialog } from '@headlessui/react'

function MyModal() {
  return (
    <Dialog open={isOpen} onClose={closeModal}>
      <Dialog.Panel className="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 shadow-lg">
        <Dialog.Title className="text-xl">Modal Title</Dialog.Title>
        <Dialog.Description>Some description</Dialog.Description>
        <button onClick={closeModal} className="text-blue-500">
          Close
        </button>
      </Dialog.Panel>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```

Headless UI components like `Dialog` allow you to focus on accessibility and functionality while styling them entirely with Tailwind.

---

## Animations and Transitions

### Transition Utilities

**Definition**: Tailwind offers several utility classes to create smooth transitions for properties like color, opacity, transform, etc.

**Example**:
```html
<button class="transition duration-300 ease-in-out transform hover:scale-110">
  Hover to Scale
</button>
```

- `transition`: Specifies which properties to animate.
- `duration-300`: Defines the animation duration (300ms).
- `ease-in-out`: Specifies the timing function.
- `hover:scale-110`: Scales the element on hover.

---

### Keyframe Animations with Tailwind

**Definition**: Tailwind also supports custom animations using keyframes, which can be added in the configuration file.

**Example**:
```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        'spin-slow': 'spin 3s linear infinite',
      },
      keyframes: {
        spin: {
          '0%': { transform: 'rotate(0deg)' },
          '100%': { transform: 'rotate(360deg)' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Apply it to an element like so:
```html
<div class="animate-spin-slow">Spinning Element</div>
```

---

### Custom Animations

**Definition**: You can create more advanced animations by defining your own keyframes and using Tailwind’s `@keyframes` and `animation` utilities.

**Example**:
```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      animation: {
        bounce: 'bounce 1s infinite',
      },
      keyframes: {
        bounce: {
          '0%, 100%': { transform: 'translateY(0)' },
          '50%': { transform: 'translateY(-10px)' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Apply it to an element:
```html
<div class="animate-bounce">Bouncing Element</div>
```

### Practical Exercise

Create a reusable card component with:
- An image, title, and description
- A button that changes color on hover
- Smooth transition effects for the card on hover
